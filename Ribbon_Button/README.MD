# Revit API

## Overview

This C# code is a part of a Revit add-in project. The main functionality of this project is to create a custom ribbon panel in Autodesk Revit with a button labeled "Hello World." When the user clicks this button, a simple dialog box (TaskDialog) with the message "Hello World" is displayed.

## Program

1. **Ribbon Panel Creation:**
- The OnStartup method is called when Revit starts.
- It creates a new ribbon panel named "NewRibbonPanel."

2. **Button Creation and Configuration:**
- A push button labeled "Hello World" is added to the created ribbon panel.
- The button is associated with the HelloWorld command class.

3. **Button Properties:**
- Tooltip is set to "Say hello to the entire world."
- A large image is assigned to the button. The image is loaded from a file path.

4. **HelloWorld Command:**
- The HelloWorld class implements the IExternalCommand interface.
- The Execute method is triggered when the button is clicked.
- It displays a TaskDialog with the message "Hello World."
