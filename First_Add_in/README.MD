# Revit API Add-In: Hello World

## Overview

This C# code is part of a Revit add-in project focused on creating a custom addin. The external tool includes a button labeled "Hello World," and when clicked, it triggers the display of a simple dialog box (TaskDialog) with the message "Hello World".

## Program

1. Namespace and Class:
- The program is in the RevitDemo namespace.
- The main class is named MyRevitCommand, and it implements the IExternalCommand interface.

2. Execute Method:
- The Execute method is required by the IExternalCommand interface and contains the main logic of the command.
- It takes three parameters: ExternalCommandData revit, ref string message, and ElementSet elements.

3. Try-Catch Block:
- The method is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions.
- If an exception occurs during the execution of the command, the catch block will capture the exception, set the error message (message), and return Result.Failed.

4. Main Logic:
- Inside the try block, there is a simple example of interacting with Revit:
- It retrieves the active document using revit.Application.ActiveUIDocument.Document.
- It displays a TaskDialog with the title "Revit" and the message "Hello World! This is my custom Revit command."

5. Result Returned:
- If the execution of the command is successful (no exceptions), it returns Result.Succeeded.
- If there is an exception, it returns Result.Failed along with the error message.

## File Structure

`CsAddPanel.cs`
- Contains the main class `CsAddPanel` implementing `IExternalApplication`. This class is responsible for creating a custom ribbon panel and button within the Revit user interface.

`HelloWorld.cs`
- Contains the `MyRevitCommand` class implementing `IExternalCommand`. This class defines the behavior of the "Hello World" command. The command is executed when the corresponding button on the custom ribbon panel is clicked. It displays a simple "Hello World" message using a `TaskDialog`.

### Project Configuration File:

`RevitDemo.csproj`
- Project file that includes configuration settings, references, and other information needed for building the project. It is responsible for compiling the source code files into the output assembly.

### Solution File:

`RevitDemo.sln`
- Solution file that ties together the `RevitDemo` project. If your solution contains more than one project.

### Build Output:

`RevitDemo.dll`
- The compiled output of the project, generated from the source code files. This DLL contains the compiled code that Revit will load and execute.

`RevitDemo.pdb`
- The program database file, containing debugging information. This file is useful for debugging purposes and is generated alongside the DLL.

### Properties File:

`AssemblyInfo.cs`
- Contains assembly-level attributes and metadata, such as version information and other assembly properties.

### Revit Add-In Manifest File:

`RevitDemo.addin`
- XML file serving as the Revit add-in manifest. Specifies information about the add-in, such as the assembly location, class name, client ID, vendor ID, and name. In this project refered as `RevitDemo` instead of `AddPanel`.
